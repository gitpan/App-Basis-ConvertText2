# Scripts for App::Basis::ConvertText2

The scripts will work on unix style systems, they may work on Windows if you are unix
a unix emulator like cygwin.

available (for convenience) in this directory but the latest release is at http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/

This requires JAVA, please make sure you have this installed before you try using this script.

### Installation

Copy both the uml and the plantuml.jar file into the same directory, this directory should be accessible via your PATH.
