This document may not be easily readable in this form, try [pdf](docs/README.pdf) or
[HTML](docs/README.html) as alternatives. These have been generated from this file and the software provided by this distribution.

This is a perl module and a script that makes use of %TITLE%

Markup is my version of [markdown] with extra fenced code-blocks to allow the
creation of charts and graphs etc. it uses [pandoc] to generate
documents in a variety of formats and optionally can use [PrinceXML] to generate great looking PDFs.

As I do not know Haskell which [pandoc] is written in and the way to add filters looks awkward, I decided to create a pre-processing system that will output markdown and HTML to [pandoc].

This also allows you to make use of templates.

As a perl module you can obtain it from https://metacpan.org/pod/App::Basis::ConvertText2
or install

    cpanm App::Basis::ConvertText2

You will then be able to use the ct2 script to process files

## Document header and variables

If you are just creating simple things, then you do not need a document header, but to make full use of the templating system, having header information is vital.

**Example**

    title: App::Basis::ConvertText2
    format: pdf
    date: 2014-05-12
    author: Kevin Mulholland
    keywords: perl, readme
    template: coverpage
    version: 5

As you can see, we use a series of key value pairs separated with a colon. The keys may be anything you like, except for the following which have special significance.

* *format* shows what output format we should default to.
* *template* shows which template we should use

The keys may be used as variables in your document or in the template, by upper-casing and prefixing and postfixing percent symbols '%'

**Example**

    version as a variable _%VERSION%

If you want to display the name of a variable without it being interpreted, prefix it
with an underscore '_', this underscore will be removed in the final document.

**Example**

    _%TITLE%

**Output**

%TITLE%

## Table of contents

As documents are processed, all the HTML headers (H1..H4) are collected together to make a table of contents. This can be used either in your template or document using the TOC variable.

**Example**

    _%TOC% will show

%TOC%

Note that if using a TOC, then the HTML headers are changed to have a number prefixed to them, this helps ensure that all the TOC references are unique.

## Fenced code-blocks

A fenced code-block is a way of showing that some text needs to be handled differently. Often this is used to allow markdown systems (and [pandoc] is no exception) to highlight program code.

code-blocks take the form

**Example**

    ~~~~{.tag argument1='fred' arg2=3}
    contents ...
    ~~~~

code-blocks **ALWAYS** start at the start of a line without any preceding whitespace.
The 'top' line of the code-block can wrap onto subsequent lines, this line is considered complete when the final '}' is seen. There should be only whitespace after the closing '}' symbol before the next line.

We use this construct to create our own handlers to generate HTML or markdown.

Note that only code-blocks described in this documentation have special handlers and
can make use of extra features such as buffering.

## Buffering data for later use

Sometimes you may either want to repeatedly use the same information or may want to use the output from one of the fenced code-blocks .

To store data we use the **to_buffer** argument to any code-block.

**Example**

~~~~{.buffer to_buffer='spark_data'}
1,4,5,20,4,5,3,1
~~~~

    ~~~~{.buffer to_buffer='spark_data'}
    1,4,5,20,4,5,3,1
    ~~~~

If the code-block would normally produce some output that we do not want displayed at the current location then we would need to use the **no_output** argument.

**Example**

~~~~{.sparkline title='green sparkline' scheme='green'
    from_buffer='spark_data' to_buffer='greenspark' no_output=1}
~~~~

    ~~~~{.sparkline title='green sparkline' scheme='green'
        from_buffer='spark_data' to_buffer='greenspark' no_output=1}
    ~~~~

We can also have the content of a code-block replaced with content from a buffer by using the **from_buffer** argument. This is also displayed in the example above.

To use the contents (or output of a buffered code-block) we wrap the name of the buffer
once again with percent '%' symbols, once again we force upper case.

**Example**

    _%SPARK_DATA% has content %SPARK_DATA%
    _%GREENSPARK% has a generated image %GREENSPARK%

Buffering also allows us to add content into markdown constructs like bullets.

**Example**

    * _%SPARK_DATA%
    * _%GREENSPARK%

**Output**

* %SPARK_DATA%
* %GREENSPARK%

## Sparklines

Sparklines are simple horizontal charts to give an indication of things, sometimes they are barcharts but we have nice smooth lines.

The only valid contents of the code-block is a single line of comma separated numbers.

The full set of optional arguments is

* title
    * used as the generated images 'alt' argument
* bgcolor
    * background color in hex (123456) or transparent
* line
    * color or the line, in hex (abcdef)
* color
    * area under the line, in hex (abcdef)
* scheme
    * color scheme, only things in red blue green orange mono are valid
* size
    * size of image, default 80x20, widthxheight

**Example**

    ~~~~{.buffer to_buffer='spark_data'}
    1,4,5,20,4,5,3,1
    ~~~~

    here is a standard sparkline

    ~~~~{.sparkline title='basic sparkline' }
    1,4,5,20,4,5,3,1
    ~~~~

    or we can draw the sparkline using buffered data

    ~~~~{.sparkline title='blue sparkline' scheme='blue' from_buffer='spark_data'}
    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.buffer to_buffer='spark_data'}
1,4,5,20,4,5,3,1
~~~~

here is a standard sparkline

~~~~{.sparkline title='basic sparkline' }
1,4,5,20,4,5,3,1
~~~~

or we can draw the sparkline using buffered data

~~~~{.sparkline title='blue sparkline' scheme='blue' from_buffer='spark_data'}
~~~~

## Charts

Displaying charts is very important when creating reports, so we have a simple **chart** code-block.

The various arguments to the code-block are shown in the examples below, hopefully they are self explanatory.

~~~~{.buffer to='chart_data'}
apples,bananas,cake,cabbage,edam,fromage,tomatoes,chips
1,2,3,5,11,22,33,55
1,2,3,5,11,22,33,55
1,2,3,5,11,22,33,55
1,2,3,5,11,22,33,55
~~~~

We will buffer some data to start

**Example**

    ~~~~{.buffer to='chart_data'}
    apples,bananas,cake,cabbage,edam,fromage,tomatoes,chips
    1,2,3,5,11,22,33,55
    1,2,3,5,11,22,33,55
    1,2,3,5,11,22,33,55
    1,2,3,5,11,22,33,55
    ~~~~

The content comprises a number of lines of comma separated data items.
The first line of the content is the legends, the subsequent lines are numbers relating
to each of these legends.

### Pie chart

**Example**

    ~~~~{.chart  title="chart1" from_buffer='chart_data' size="400x400"
        xaxis='things xways' yaxis='Vertical things' format='pie'
        legends='a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h' }
    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.chart  title="chart1" from_buffer='chart_data' size="400x400" xaxis='things xways' yaxis='Vertical things' format='pie' legends='a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h' }
~~~~

### Bar chart

**Example**

    ~~~~{.chart  title="chart1" from_buffer='chart_data' size="600x400"
        xaxis='things ways' yaxis='Vertical things' format='bars'
        legends='a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h' }
    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.chart  title="chart1" from_buffer='chart_data' size="600x400" xaxis='things xways' yaxis='Vertical things' format='bars' legends='a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h' }
~~~~

### Mixed chart

**Example**

    ~~~~{.chart  title="chart1" from_buffer='chart_data' size="600x400"
      xaxis='things xways' yaxis='Vertical things' format='mixed'
      legends='a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h'
      types='lines linepoints lines bars' }
    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.chart  title="chart1" from_buffer='chart_data' size="600x400" xaxis='things xways' yaxis='Vertical things' format='mixed' legends='a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h'
types='lines linepoints lines bars' }

## Message Sequence Charts - mscgen

Software (or process) engineers often want to be able to show the sequence in which a number of events take place. We use the [msc] program for this. This program needs to be installed onto your system to allow this to work

The content for this code-block is EXACTLY the same that you would use as input to [msc]

There are only optional 2 arguments

* title
    * used as the generated images 'alt' argument
* size
    * size of image, widthxheight

**Example**

    ~~~~{.mscgen  title="mscgen1" size="600x400}
    # MSC for some fictional process
    msc {
      a,b,c;

      a->b [ label = "ab()" ] ;
      b->c [ label = "bc(TRUE)"];
      c=>c [ label = "process(1)" ];
      c=>c [ label = "process(2)" ];
      ...;
      c=>c [ label = "process(n)" ];
      c=>c [ label = "process(END)" ];
      a<<=c [ label = "callback()"];
      ---  [ label = "If more to run", ID="*" ];
      a->a [ label = "next()"];
      a->c [ label = "ac1()\nac2()"];
      b<-c [ label = "cb(TRUE)"];
      b->b [ label = "stalled(...)"];
      a<-b [ label = "ab() = FALSE"];
    }
    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.mscgen  title="mscgen1" size="600x400}
# MSC for some fictional process
msc {
  a,b,c;

  a->b [ label = "ab()" ] ;
  b->c [ label = "bc(TRUE)"];
  c=>c [ label = "process(1)" ];
  c=>c [ label = "process(2)" ];
  ...;
  c=>c [ label = "process(n)" ];
  c=>c [ label = "process(END)" ];
  a<<=c [ label = "callback()"];
  ---  [ label = "If more to run", ID="*" ];
  a->a [ label = "next()"];
  a->c [ label = "ac1()\nac2()"];
  b<-c [ label = "cb(TRUE)"];
  b->b [ label = "stalled(...)"];
  a<-b [ label = "ab() = FALSE"];
}

## DIagrams Through Ascii Art - ditaa

This is a special system to turn ASCII art into pretty pictures, nice to render diagrams.
You do need to make sure that you are using a proper monospaced font with your editor otherwise things will go awry with spaces. See [ditaa] for reference.

The content for this code-block must be the same that you would use to with the [ditaa] software

* title
    * used as the generated images 'alt' argument
* size
    * size of image, default 80x20, widthxheight

**Example**

    ~~~~{.ditaa }

## UML Diagrams

Software engineers love to draw diagrams, [PlantUML] is a java component to make this simple.

You will need to have a script on your system called 'uml' that calls java with the component.

Here is mine, it is also available in the scripts directory in the

~~~~{ .shell}
#!/bin/bash
# run plantuml
# moodfarm@cpan.org

# we assume that the plantuml.jar file is in the same directory as this executable
EXEC_DIR=`dirname $0`
PLANTUML="$EXEC_DIR/plantuml.jar"

INPUT=$1
OUPUT=$2
function show_usage  {
    arg=$1
    err=$2
    if [ "$err" == "" ] ; then
        err=1
    fi
      "Create a UML diagram from an input text file
(see http://plantuml.sourceforge.net/ for reference)
    usage: $0 inputfile outputfile.png
"
    if [ "$arg" != "" ] ; then
        echo "$arg
"
    fi
    exit $err
}
if [ "$INPUT" == "-help" ] ; then
    show_usage "" 0
fi
if [ ! -f "$INPUT" ] ; then
    show_usage "ERROR: Could not find input file $1"
fi
if [ "$OUPUT" == "" ] ; then
    show_usage "ERROR: No output file specified"
fi
# we use the pipe option to control output into the file we want
cat "$INPUT" | java -jar $PLANTUML -nbthread auto -pipe >$OUPUT
# exit 0
~~~~

The content for this code-block must be the same that you would use to with the [PlantUML] software

The arguments allowed are

* title
    * used as the generated images 'alt' argument
* size
    * size of image, default 80x20, widthxheight

**Example**

    ~~~~{.uml }
    ' this is a comment on one line
    /' this is a
    multi-line
    comment'/
    Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
    Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

    Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
    Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.uml }
' this is a comment on one line
/' this is a
multi-line
comment'/
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
~~~~

[PlantUML] can also create simple application interfaces [See Salt]

**Example**

    ~~~~{.uml }
    @startuml
    salt
    {
      Just plain text
      [This is my button]

## Graphviz

[graphviz] allows you to draw connected graphs using text descriptions.

The content for this code-block must be the same that you would use to with the [graphviz] software

The arguments allowed are

* title
    * used as the generated images 'alt' argument
* size
    * size of image, default 80x20, widthxheight

      subgraph cluster_0 {
        style=filled;
        color=lightgrey;
        node [style=filled,color=white];
        a0 -> a1 -> a2 -> a3;
        label = "process #1";
      }

      subgraph cluster_1 {
        node [style=filled];
        b0 -> b1 -> b2 -> b3;
        label = "process #2";

## Venn diagram

Creating venn diagrams may sometimes be useful, though to be honest this implementation is not great, if I could find a better way to do this then I would!

**Example**

    ~~~~{.venn  title="sample venn diagram"
        legends="team1 team2 team3" scheme="rgb" explain='1'}
    abel edward momo albert jack julien chris
    edward isabel antonio delta albert kevin jake
    gerald jake kevin lucia john edward

## Barcodes

Sometimes having barcodes in your document may be useful, certainly qrcodes are popular.

The code-block only allows a single line of content. Some of the barcode types need
content of a specific length, warnings will be generated if the length is incorrect.

The arguments allowed are

* title
    * used as the generated images 'alt' argument
* height
    * height of image
* notext
    * flag to show we do not want the content text printed underneath the barcode.
* version
    * version of qrcode, defaults to '2'
* pixels
    * number of pixels that is a 'bit' in a qrcode, defaults to '2'

### QR code

As qrcodes are now quite so prevalent, they have their own code-block type.

We can do qr codes, just put in anything you like, this is a URL for bbc news

**Example**

    ~~~~{.qrcode }
    http://news.bbc.co.uk
    ~~~~

    To change the size of the barcode

    ~~~~{.qrcode height='80'}
    http://news.bbc.co.uk
    ~~~~

    To use version 1

    Version 1 only allows 15 characters

    ~~~~{.qrcode height=60 version=1}
    smaller text..
    ~~~~

    To change pixel size

    ~~~~{.qrcode pixels=5}

## YAML convert to JSON

Software engineers often use [JSON] to transfer data between systems, this often is not nice to create for documentation. [YAML] which is a superset of [JSON] is much cleaner
so we have a

**Example**

    ~~~~{.yamlasjson }
    list:
      - array: [1,2,3,7]
        channel: BBC3
        date: 2013-10-20
        time: 20:30
      - array: [1,2,3,9]
        channel: BBC4
        date: 2013-11-20
        time: 21:00

    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.yamlasjson }
list:
  - array: [1,2,3,7]
    channel: BBC3
    date: 2013-10-20
    time: 20:30
  - array: [1,2,3,9]
    channel: BBC4
    date: 2013-11-20
    time: 21:00

~~~~

## Table

Create a simple table using CSV style data

* class
    * HTML/CSS class name
* id
    * HTML/CSS class
* width
    * width of the table
* style
    * style the table if not doing anything else
* legends
    * csv of headings for table, these correspond to the data sets
* separator
    * what should be used to separate cells, defaults to ','

**Example**

    ~~~~{.table separator=',' width='100%' legends=1
        from_buffer='chart_data'}
    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.table separator=',' width='100%' legends=1
    from_buffer='chart_data'}
~~~~

## Links

With one code-block we can create a list of links

The code-block contents comprises a number of lines with a reference and a URL.
The reference comes first, then a '|' to separate it from the URL.

The reference may then be used elsewhere in your document if you enclose it with square ([]) brackets

There is only one argument

* class
    * CSS class to style the list

## Version table

Documents often need revision history. I use this code-block to create a nice
table of this history.

The content for this code-block comprises a number of sections, each section then makes a row in the generated table.

    version YYYY-MM-DD
       change text
       more changes

The version may be any string, YYYY-MM-DD shows the date the change took place.
Alternate date formats is DD-MM-YYYY and '/' may also be used as a field separator.

* class
    * HTML/CSS class name
* id
    * HTML/CSS class
* width
    * width of the table
* style
    * style the table if not doing anything else

**Example**

    ~~~~{.version class='versiontable' width='100%'}
    0.1 2014-04-12
      * removed ConvertFile.pm
      * using Path::Tiny rather than other things
      * changed to use pandoc fences
        ~~~~{.tag} rather than xml format <tag>
    0.006 2014-04-10
      * first release to github
    ~~~~

**Output**

~~~~{.version class='versiontable' width='100%'}
0.1 2014-04-12
  * removed ConvertFile.pm
  * using Path::Tiny rather than other things
  * changed to use pandoc fences ~~~~{.tag} rather than xml format <tag>
0.006 2014-04-10
  * first release to github

## Start a new page - page

Nice and simple, starts a new page

**Example**

    ~~~~{.page}
    ~~~~

## Gotchas about variables

* Variables used within the content area of a code-block will be evaluated before processing that block, if a variable has not yet been defined or saved to a buffer then it will only be evaluated at the end of document processing, so output may not be as expected.
* Variables used in markdown tables may not do what you expect if the variable is multi-line.

## Using ct2 script to process files

Included in the distribution is a script to make use of all of the above code-blocks to alter [markdown] into nicely formatted documents.

Here is the help


    $ ct2 --help

    Syntax: ct2 [options] filename

    About:  Convert my modified markdown text files into other formats, by
      default will create HTML in same directory as the input file, will only
      process .md files.
    If there is no output option used the output will be to file of same name
    as input filename but with an extension (if provided) from the document, use
    format: keyword (pdf html doc).

    [options]
        -h, -?, --help     Show help
        -c, --clean        Clean up the cache before use
        -e, --embed        Embed images into HTML, do not use this if converting
            to doc/odt or pdf via libreoffice
        -o, --output       Filename to store the output as, extension will
            control conversion
        -p, --prince       Convert to PDF using prince rather than libreoffice,
            can handle embedded images
        -s, --template     name of template to use
        -v, --verbose      verbose mode

If you are creating HTML documents to send out in emails or share in other ways, and use locally referenced images, then it is best to make use of the **--embed** option to pack these images into the HTML file.

If you are using [PrinceXML] remember that it is only free for non-commercial use, it also adds a purple **P** to the top right of the first page of your document.
